## 🏗️ What I Built

In this project, I developed a **complete digital learning management system (LMS)** for Tata Steel's workforce with a user-centric and scalable approach. The core idea was to replace traditional training and HRD workflows with a centralized, efficient, and self-service solution.

**Key deliverables:**

- ✅ A responsive frontend for users to browse, register, and complete courses
- ✅ Admin panel to manage modules, events, documents, and certificates
- ✅ Session-based authentication to ensure secure access
- ✅ Routing with caching support using **Next.js catch memory**
- ✅ In-progress backend using **Prisma** and **MongoDB** for persistent storage

🎯 The goal was to align with Tata Steel’s ongoing digital transformation strategy, improve accessibility, and enhance learning experiences across the organization.
