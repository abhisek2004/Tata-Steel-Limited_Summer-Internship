## üåü Overview

This project is a full-stack Learning & Development (L&D) web application tailored for Tata Steel‚Äôs workforce. It empowers employees to:

- üìö Register for training programs
- üéØ Track learning progress
- üì• Access and download learning resources
- üéì Receive digital certificates after completion
- üìä Administer and manage course content centrally

The entire platform is built using modern web technologies and deployed for high availability on **Vercel**, ensuring accessibility and performance.

---

## üèóÔ∏è What I Built

In this project, I developed a **complete digital learning management system (LMS)** for Tata Steel's workforce with a user-centric and scalable approach. The core idea was to replace traditional training and HRD workflows with a centralized, efficient, and self-service solution.

**Key deliverables:**

- ‚úÖ A responsive frontend for users to browse, register, and complete courses
- ‚úÖ Admin panel to manage modules, events, documents, and certificates
- ‚úÖ Session-based authentication to ensure secure access
- ‚úÖ Routing with caching support using **Next.js catch memory**
- ‚úÖ In-progress backend using **Prisma** and **MongoDB** for persistent storage

üéØ The goal was to align with Tata Steel‚Äôs ongoing digital transformation strategy, improve accessibility, and enhance learning experiences across the organization.

Here's a complete, step-by-step guide on **how to run the frontend** of your Tata Steel Learning & Development platform locally, written in a clean, developer-friendly format ‚Äî only for the **frontend (React + Next.js + TypeScript)** setup. ‚úÖ

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Frontend Locally

> ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript
> üì¶ Package Manager: npm
> üß† Note: Make sure Node.js is installed (Recommended: Node v16+)

---

### üîß Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

---

### üì¶ Step 2: Install Dependencies (Handle Peer Deps Issues)

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

> üîç This command installs all the required node modules while ignoring peer dependency conflicts (which may occur with packages like React 18, Tailwind, etc.).

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Install Additional Dependency (react-is)

```bash
npm install react-is
```

> ‚úÖ This package is often needed by libraries like `react-dom`, `formik`, or other React utility tools.

---

### üèóÔ∏è Step 4: Build the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

> üß± This will compile the Next.js project for production. It performs static optimization, transpiles TypeScript/JSX, and prepares everything in the `.next` folder.

---

### üåê Step 5: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> üñ•Ô∏è This launches your frontend at:
> `http://localhost:3000`
> Open it in your browser to view the app.

---

### ‚úÖ Output

Once it's running, you should see your **Tata Steel L\&D Platform homepage**, complete with:

- üìö Course modules
- üë§ User dashboard
- üéì Registration & Certificate section
- üì• Learning content and resources

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Tips

- If the server fails to start, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall:

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  ```

- Use `.env.local` if you have environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, etc.)

---

Here's a complete **step-by-step guide** to help you or any team member run the **Tata Steel Learning & Development Platform** ‚Äî including both **frontend and backend**, with **MongoDB integration**. This also covers what to install on a fresh system and how to run the project locally. üëá

---

# üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project (Frontend + Backend + Database)

> üíª Platform Stack: React (Next.js), Node.js, Prisma, MongoDB
> üåê Deployment-ready: Yes (Vercel + MongoDB Atlas)

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Download Before Running

### üîó System Requirements

| Tool          | Version (Recommended)     |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Node.js       | v16+ or v18+              |
| npm           | v7+                       |
| Git           | Latest                    |
| MongoDB Atlas | Free Tier / Local MongoDB |
| Code Editor   | VS Code (Optional)        |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Setup & Run (Clean System)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tata-steel-learning-platform.git
cd tata-steel-learning-platform
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install All Dependencies (Frontend + Backend Shared)

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm install react-is
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI like this:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/tata-steel-learning?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

üìå Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.

> üìñ Refer to [`MongoDB Setup Guide`](f) for step-by-step help.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to MongoDB

‚úÖ Option A: If this is a fresh setup

```bash
npm run setup:mongodb
```

This will:

- Generate Prisma client
- Push schema to MongoDB
- Seed initial data

‚úÖ Option B: If you're migrating from SQLite

```bash
npm run migrate:sqlite-to-mongodb
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Backend (API + DB Connectivity)

This project uses **Next.js API routes**, so **you don‚Äôt need a separate Express server**.

> The backend will automatically work when `npm run dev` is started from the root.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Frontend (Local Dev Server)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) üöÄ

---

## üß™ Optional: Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview a production build:

```bash
npm run start
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è JWT Authentication (for APIs)

> JWT and NextAuth.js are both supported

To test JWT APIs:

```bash
POST /api/auth/login
```

Pass JSON:

```json
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Then use:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```
